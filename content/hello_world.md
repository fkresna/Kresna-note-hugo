After trying with several other blogging platforms such as Wordpress, Blogger and so on I feel that I need simpler solution to accommodate my needs, I was trying Jekyll because I interested with static website which is simple and does not need a lot of resources but there is no easy installation for ruby or Jekyll around 2013 - 2014, I manage to install it successfully but feel too much hassle doing it so I just uninstall it. Time passes and I feel the urge to write again especially for the note that I create during development, Sadly some of the development notes are missing or I just don't know where I put it.

After several years passed, I search again static website generator maybe someone creates another one so I found [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) it looks good then I tried to install it, It is quite straight forward and has very easy installation steps so I decided to use it to write my development note using Hugo platform.
